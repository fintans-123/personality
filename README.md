# personality

This repo contains my validation of the mini-ipip on a UK nationally and politically representative sample, along with modelling of personality traits as predictors of current voting intention in the UK. 

# Data availability

Unfortunately, I am not in a position to be able to share the data I worked with to reach these findings, as this data remains the property of my employer. However, to allow those who are interested to see more detailed findings, I have uploaded a rendered markdown in HTML format.

Please do contact me if you have any questions at all.
